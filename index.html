        <p class="DNA">Rosalind Franklin had X-ray diffraction images of DNA, the photo 51 is the most famous, and the one that was shown to Watson. Watson and Crick created the double helix model of DNA based on this photo and published in 1953. They got the Nobel Prize in 1962 with Mauricie Wilkins, but Rosalind was left behind.</p></div>
